# Dashboard

This is the code for the frontend part of the user management dashboard for user of SuperTokens. This dashboard will eventually allow you to do several actions related to your app users. For example, it will allow you to:

-   See a list of users
-   Edit user info
-   Delete users
-   Manage roles and access control

This is packaged along with the backend SDK and can be accessed by integrating the backend SDK into your app and visiting: `{apiDomain}/{apiBasePath}/dashboard`
